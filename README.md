### üñ•Ô∏è Local / VPS (Recommended)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ctrlzverse/Pinfairy.git
    cd Pinfairy
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example` and fill in your credentials.

    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit the .env file with your values

4.  **Install Playwright browsers:**

    playwright install
    ```

5.  **Run the bot:**
    ```bash
    python bot.py
    ```

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Replit (Cloud Deployment)

Due to Replit's limitations, Playwright cannot run locally. This bot is configured to use a remote browser via **[browserless.io](https://www.browserless.io/)**.

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.

2.  **Create a new Replit** and import your forked repository.

3.  **Get a `browserless.io` API Token:**
    - Sign up for a **free account** at [browserless.io](https://www.browserless.io/).
    - Copy your API token.

4.  **Add Replit Secrets:**
    - In your Replit project, go to the "Secrets" tab (lock icon).
    - Add your Telegram and `browserless.io` credentials:
        - `API_ID`: Your Telegram API ID.
        - `API_HASH`: Your Telegram API Hash.
        - `BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram Bot Token.
        - `ADMIN_IDS`: Your user ID for admin access.
        - `BROWSERLESS_TOKEN`: Your token from `browserless.io`.
        - `BOT_PREFIX`: Custom command prefix (e.g., `.`, `!`, `/`). Defaults to `/`.

5.  **Run the Bot:**
    - Click the "Run" button. Replit will automatically install dependencies and start the bot. You do **not** need to run `playwright install`.
